    "text": "1.1 Powers and Roots\nPowers and roots are common transformations.\n\\(X \\rightarrow X^p\\)\nIf p is negative, then the transform is an inverse power\n\\(X^{-2} = 1/X^2\\)\nFractions are roots\n\\(X^{1/2} = \\sqrt{X}\\)\netc.\n\n1.1.1 Box-Cox\nThe Box-Cox family of power transformations is a special, more general, transformation\n$X X^{(p)} (X^p - 1) / p $\n\n\n1.1.2 Considerations\nPower transformations make sense only when values are all positive. Some transforms (e.g. log, square root) don’t work on negative data. One workaround is to add a constant to everything before power transforming.\nAlso, power transformations only make sense when the ratio of the largest values to the smallest values is sufficiently large. If the ratio is close to 1, then the power transforms are essentially linear and basically don’t do anything. One trick here is to subtract a constant to change the ratio\nSo if we look at the difference between log10 of 2011 through 2015 below compared to x - 2010 (e.g. 2011 - 2010, etc), we can see how these value change by subtracting a constant.\nRaw Version\n\nyrs = 2011:2015\n\nlog10.(yrs)\n\n5-element Vector{Float64}:\n 3.303412070596742\n 3.30362797638389\n 3.3038437748886547\n 3.3040594662175993\n 3.3042750504771283\n\n\nSubtract Consant\n\nyrs_scaled = yrs .- 2010\n\nlog10.(yrs_scaled)\n\n5-element Vector{Float64}:\n 0.0\n 0.3010299956639812\n 0.47712125471966244\n 0.6020599913279624\n 0.6989700043360189"

    "text": "1.2 Transforming Skewness\nIt’s worthwhile to transform skewed predictors. One reason is that models such as OLS use means, and means are not good summaries of skewed distributions\nGenerally, log transforms are good for transforming right-skewed distributions and power transforms are good for transforming left-skewed distributions.\nWe usually want to prefer interpretable transformations over less-interpretable ones, assuming they perform equally well on the data.\nAlso! Since scales in social sciences don’t really have a meaning, there’s no reason to prefer an untransformed version of them."

Inversely, if the “bulge” points up/left, we can try transforming the X variable up the ladder of powers.\nSometimes we might need to transform both X and y variables before modeling."
